# Hi Folks 

## Bio

I am a passionate ML Practioner. In particular, I am interested in MLOps and Machine Learning Systems. 
That's why I lead Engineering Labs initiative at [MLOpsCommunity](https://mlops.community/).

Outside my work at Google, I spend time on testing technologies, building demos, writing [articles](https://ivannardini.medium.com/) and occasionally doing presentations in communities.
