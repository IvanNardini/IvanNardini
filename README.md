# Hi Folks 

## Bio

I am a passionate ML Practioner. In particular, I am interested in MLOps and Machine Learning Systems. 
That's why I lead Engineering Labs initiative at [MLOpsCommunity](https://mlops.community/).

Outside my work at Google, I spend time on testing technologies, building demos, writing [articles](https://ivannardini.medium.com/) and occasionally doing presentations in communities.

If you are looking at personal demos, [here](https://github.com/IvanNardini/1-Demos.git).

To build end to end demos, I need to plan some [hands-on](https://github.com/IvanNardini/2-Engineering.git).

Also I have to learn about different programming languages, practices such as automated build and test, continuous integration, and continuous delivery and Cloud. All is [here](https://github.com/IvanNardini/3-Learning.git).

Finally, I need to stay up to date reading articles, studying other's projects and soon...That's the reason why [utils](https://github.com/IvanNardini/4-Utils).
